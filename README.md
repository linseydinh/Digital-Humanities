## Abstract

Digital + Humanities was a collaborative project dedicated to showing the intersectionality of the Digital Humanities field as we examined how the digital can not exist without the humanities, and vice versa. To accomplish this project, each of us utilized one of three articles, while one of us concluded the project. Our articles were: McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?", Gallon's "Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities'' , and Grimmer's "We Are All Social Scientist Now". Tara McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White", presented by Yvonne Gonzales, demonstrated a historical account of computation. She highlights that “computers themselves are encoders of culture”, implicating that computers are inherently multicultural, as the digital coexist with the humanities (McPherson, 2012). Kim Gallon’s “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities”, presented by me (Linsey Dinh), discusses the “technology of recovery” as a tool of restoring black humanity that was taken away by racism, and the intersectional field of the Black Digital Humanities, which combines Black Studies and Digital Humanities. Her article allows us to reflect on how the intersection between the digital and humanities may be inherently biased and influenced by a Eurocentric system of power. Tying these concepts together, Justin Grimmer’s "We Are All Social Scientist Now", presented by Rohan Parekh, studies the social sciences' role in the field of computer science. With the massive amounts of data acquired with modern methods, it may be easier to acquire more accurate observations in social sciences, however, this may also create obstacles which Grimmer supposes can be accommodated with bridging different disciplines. Overall, Jus Lim showed that these articles worked together harmoniously to represent the growth of interdisciplinary fields within the digital humanities, advocate for the underrepresented and silenced voices in the humanities, and showed how these voices - though underrepresented - are embedded in digital technologies. I am grateful to be a collaborator on this project, as it was very insightful being able to experience different perspectives on these articles and the concept of digital humanities as a whole.
